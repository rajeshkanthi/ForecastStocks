This code is simply copied from youtube shorts where it was used to predict the stock values.
 Firstly, I used this python code for my mini project and later learned about the python language, facebook prophet library which was used for predicting the stock values .
 Secondly, I learned about streamlit server which made the python code runable as a server side webpage.
 Lastly, I observed yfinance which gave me the data of different companies based on that I performed the prediction functions using prophet library functions.
 Thank you. As it helped to clear my mini project, it can help you too!
 Remember to use the updated software which can be depreciated in no time.
